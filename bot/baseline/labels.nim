## VENDORED COPY of `src/ctf/labels.nim` from Metta-AI/coworld-ctf.
##
## Source: coworld-ctf `main` @ 3a2d4fd; the module was introduced by
## `dbcacc5` ("labels: make the sprite-label vocabulary a guarded single
## source of truth", 2026-07-28) and the engine was switched to emit from it
## by `982bf50` the same day — i.e. SIX DAYS AFTER this archive's fork base
## (`5997098`, 2026-07-22). That gap is why this archive's bot was still
## scanning for `"plasma arc"`, a label the 0.7.x spray-can reskin
## (`3428bd8`, 2026-07-28) had already renamed out of existence.
##
## WHY A COPY. Upstream's bot reaches the real module through
## `players/baseline/config.nims`, which puts the repo's `src/` on the Nim
## search path. This archive builds standalone from `bot/` as the Docker
## context (see `Dockerfile.sandbox`) and has no coworld-ctf checkout to
## point at, so the vocabulary is vendored instead. The module is
## deliberately import-free, which is what makes vendoring viable at all.
##
## RE-SYNC BEFORE EVERY TOURNAMENT BUILD. A vendored copy is exactly the
## "copy that drifts silently" this module exists to prevent, so the copy
## only buys the CONSUMER half of the guarantee: because `baseline.nim` now
## spells every scanned label as a constant from this file, the bot can no
## longer disagree with the vocabulary it was built against — a rename that
## reaches this file turns into a compile error rather than an empty seq.
## It does NOT detect this file falling behind upstream. Diff it against
## `src/ctf/labels.nim` at the game commit you are building for; the
## contract test that guards the producer half lives upstream in
## `tests/test_label_contract.nim` and cannot run from this archive.
##
## Everything below this header is upstream's file, verbatim.
##
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## Sprite-label vocabulary: the machine-readable CONTRACT between the engine
## (the producer, `global.nim`) and AI policies (the consumers, e.g.
## `players/baseline/`). A policy has no API into the sim — it reads the wire,
## finds sprite objects by their label string, and steers off their positions.
## So a label is not a debug tag: it is the observation schema, and renaming one
## is a breaking change to every policy in the league.
##
## The failure mode this module exists to prevent is SILENT. Labels are computed
## at render time and never serialized (flatty writes `SimServer` positionally,
## so replays carry no label bytes), nothing type-checks a label string, and
## `spriteObjectsWithLabel` returns an empty seq for a name that no longer
## exists. Rename `"med kit"` to `"medkit"` and every bot simply stops routing
## to kits — no crash, no failing assertion, no log line. Hoisting the strings
## to consts makes at least the producer/consumer halves share one definition,
## and `tests/test_label_contract.nim` guards the rest.
##
## **Contract labels live here; spectator CHROME deliberately does not.** The
## renderer emits far more labels than this file names — map bands, the replay
## scrubber and transport, the roster and score pips, interstitial text, hit
## flashes, muzzle blooms, tracer stages, splatters, damage pops, endzone glow,
## the cog rig's limbs. No policy reads any of them; they exist for the
## inspector and for sprite dedup. Hoisting them here would imply a stability
## promise the engine does not owe — the broadcast view is free to re-cut its
## chrome any week. They are still covered by the golden manifest (a chrome
## rename shows up as a diff you can wave through), just not as API.
##
## **Renaming anything in this file is a four-surface change**, all in the same
## commit: this module, `tests/label_manifest.txt` (the golden vocabulary),
## `docs/RULES.md` (the published observation spec policy authors read), and
## `players/baseline/` (the reference consumer). The contract test fails until
## the manifest agrees; the other two surfaces are on you.
##
## **This module must keep ZERO imports** — not even `std/strutils`. The
## baseline bot imports it via `players/baseline/config.nims`, and the bot's
## Docker image ships no `data/` directory. Any import here risks dragging the
## renderer's cone (pixie / mummy / aseprite, all of which load assets at
## import or first use) into a binary that cannot satisfy it. If an addition
## seems to need an import, change the API instead.

  LabelPrefixCogSprayCan* = "cog spray can "

  LabelTokenNade* = "nade"
    ## Optional identity-badge suffix: the wearer carries a grenade.

const LabelHpBarSegments* = 3
  ## The overhead health bar's FIXED segment count — the denominator of every
  ## `hp <lit>/<total>` label, and the single place that number is allowed to
  ## live. Producer and consumer must agree on it exactly (an exact-match scan
  ## for "hp 2/3" finds nothing in a world that emits "hp 2/4"), so neither
  ## side gets to spell it itself: both go through `labelHp`.
  ##
  ## It is NOT the hit-point config, and the distinction is load-bearing rather
  ## than pedantic. The bar always draws three thirds whatever `hitPoints` is
  ## set to — a 99-hp game would otherwise paint a ~296px ribbon over a 16px
  ## sprite — so the engine maps `hp + shieldHp` onto thirds (ceil, floor of
  ## one lit segment for anyone alive) and the NUMERATOR is that lit-segment
  ## count, not a hit-point count. Today `hitPoints` also defaults to 3, which
  ## makes the two quantities numerically identical and makes it look like the
  ## label reports hit points. It does not. A retune of `hitPoints` alone must
  ## leave this constant — and every emitted hp label — untouched; only a
  ## redesign of the BAR moves it.
  ##
  ## The reference policy currently builds its scan denominator from its own
  ## `MaxHp = 3` (players/baseline/baseline.nim), i.e. from the hit-point
  ## coincidence rather than from the bar. That is the exact drift this
  ## constant closes, and it stays open until the bot calls `labelHp`;
  ## tests/test_label_contract.nim asserts the two have not diverged yet.
