## VENDORED COPY of `src/ctf/labels.nim` from Metta-AI/coworld-ctf.
##
## Source: coworld-ctf `main` @ 3a2d4fd; the module was introduced by
## `dbcacc5` ("labels: make the sprite-label vocabulary a guarded single
## source of truth", 2026-07-28) and the engine was switched to emit from it
## by `982bf50` the same day — i.e. SIX DAYS AFTER this archive's fork base
## (`5997098`, 2026-07-22). That gap is why this archive's bot was still
## scanning for `"plasma arc"`, a label the 0.7.x spray-can reskin
## (`3428bd8`, 2026-07-28) had already renamed out of existence.
##
## WHY A COPY. Upstream's bot reaches the real module through
## `players/baseline/config.nims`, which puts the repo's `src/` on the Nim
## search path. This archive builds standalone from `bot/` as the Docker
## context (see `Dockerfile.sandbox`) and has no coworld-ctf checkout to
## point at, so the vocabulary is vendored instead. The module is
## deliberately import-free, which is what makes vendoring viable at all.
##
## VERIFIED IN SYNC 2026-09-01 with the build the league actually runs:
## coworld package `paintbot` v0.7.263, source commit 9d26cc26 (GameVersion
## 50, the season-2 battle-royale flip). This file is byte-identical to
## `src/ctf/labels.nim` at that commit. The re-sync from v0.7.173 added the
## barrier pickup family, the hp-bar shield separator, the human-only `kd`/
## `roster` HUD rows, and the `handicap`/`perks`/`trench`/`puddle`/`zone`
## stated markers; `endzone` markers are now ABSENT on flagless BR maps.
##
## RE-SYNC BEFORE EVERY TOURNAMENT BUILD. A vendored copy is exactly the
## "copy that drifts silently" this module exists to prevent, so the copy
## only buys the CONSUMER half of the guarantee: because `baseline.nim` now
## spells every scanned label as a constant from this file, the bot can no
## longer disagree with the vocabulary it was built against — a rename that
## reaches this file turns into a compile error rather than an empty seq.
## It does NOT detect this file falling behind upstream. Re-check it against
## the CURRENT package's own commit, which the Observatory reports:
##
##     coworld show <coworld_id> --json   # .manifest.game.runnable.source_url
##
## then diff this file against `src/ctf/labels.nim` there. The contract test
## that guards the producer half lives upstream in
## `tests/test_label_contract.nim` and cannot run from this archive.
##
## Everything below this header is upstream's file, verbatim.
##
## Sprite-label vocabulary: the machine-readable CONTRACT between the engine
## (the producer, `global.nim`) and AI policies (the consumers, e.g.
## `players/baseline/`). A policy has no API into the sim — it reads the wire,
## finds sprite objects by their label string, and steers off their positions.
## So a label is not a debug tag: it is the observation schema, and renaming one
## is a breaking change to every policy in the league.
##
## The failure mode this module exists to prevent is SILENT. Labels are computed
## at render time and never serialized (flatty writes `SimServer` positionally,
## so replays carry no label bytes), nothing type-checks a label string, and
## `spriteObjectsWithLabel` returns an empty seq for a name that no longer
## exists. Rename `"med kit"` to `"medkit"` and every bot simply stops routing
## to kits — no crash, no failing assertion, no log line. Hoisting the strings
## to consts makes at least the producer/consumer halves share one definition,
## and `tests/test_label_contract.nim` guards the rest.
##
## **Contract labels live here; spectator CHROME deliberately does not.** The
## renderer emits far more labels than this file names — map bands, the replay
## scrubber and transport, the roster and score pips, interstitial text, hit
## flashes, muzzle blooms, tracer stages, splatters, damage pops, endzone glow,
## the cog rig's limbs. No policy reads any of them; they exist for the
## inspector and for sprite dedup. Hoisting them here would imply a stability
## promise the engine does not owe — the broadcast view is free to re-cut its
## chrome any week. They are still covered by the golden manifest (a chrome
## rename shows up as a diff you can wave through), just not as API.
##
## **Renaming anything in this file is a four-surface change**, all in the same
## commit: this module, `tests/label_manifest.txt` (the golden vocabulary),
## `docs/RULES.md` (the published observation spec policy authors read), and
## `players/baseline/` (the reference consumer). The contract test fails until
## the manifest agrees; the other two surfaces are on you.
##
## **This module must keep ZERO imports** — not even `std/strutils`. The
## baseline bot imports it via `players/baseline/config.nims`, and the bot's
## Docker image ships no `data/` directory. Any import here risks dragging the
## renderer's cone (pixie / mummy / aseprite, all of which load assets at
## import or first use) into a binary that cannot satisfy it. If an addition
## seems to need an import, change the API instead.

    ## A LIVING player: `player <color> <side>`. The board stream also puts

    ## absence is how a policy learns it is dead.
  LabelPrefixCorpse* = "corpse "

  LabelPrefixHp* = "hp "

    ## Separates the hp bar's `<hp>/<maxHp>` head from the shield tail —
    ## shared so the parser (players/baseline) and labelHp cannot drift.
    ## Overhead health bar, `hp <lit>/<total>`. A distinct object centered on
    ## its player and fog-gated with them: attach it by proximity.
  LabelPrefixLives* = "lives "
    ## Own top-right HUD text, `lives <hp>hp x<lives>`. Reads PAST the base hp
    ## cap — a shield carrier shows 6hp — which is how a policy detects its own
    ## shield without seeing the carry marker.
  LabelPrefixWeapon* = "weapon "
    ## Own weapon readout, `weapon <token>`. Authoritative for your own hands;
    ## inferring your weapon from floating markers gets it wrong under fog.
  LabelPrefixKd* = "kd "
    ## Own kill/death readout, `kd <kills>/<deaths>` — a MATCH statistic, not
    ## a per-round one: it reads roster.nim's `matchKillsDeaths` (the
    ## address-keyed RewardAccount tally recordKill/recordDeath maintain),
    ## NOT the per-round Player.kills/Player.deaths (sim_types.nim) that
    ## reset every startGame. Real attribution either way — both counters are
    ## driven from the same recordKill/recordDeath call sites — but the
    ## Player fields are mixed into gameHash and zeroed at every round
    ## boundary (right for replay determinism and per-round reward math),
    ## while this label needs the number a human watches to survive that
    ## boundary, so it reads the account-level total instead. This label is
    ## pure emission of state the sim already tracks, never a new source of
    ## truth.
    ##
    ## HUMAN-WIRE ONLY, deliberately: `buildSpriteProtocolPlayerUpdates` gates
    ## this marker on `not spritesOff`, the same flag that already splits the
    ## fog overlay/splatters/damage-pops as human-only. A Sprites Off
    ## (0x87) viewer — every scripted league bot, `server.nim`'s own
    ## opt-in gate — gets a BYTE-IDENTICAL stream to before this label
    ## existed; only a human `/client/player` connection (spritesOff=false)
    ## receives it. This is unlike `LabelPrefixLives`/`LabelPrefixWeapon`/
    ## `LabelPrefixOwnAim` above, which are semantic and ungated (bots read
    ## them too) — a policy wanting its own kill/death count is a real,
    ## separate ask (one-line ungate here) that was not in scope for the
    ## human-HUD request this label was added for.
  LabelPrefixRoster* = "roster "
    ## One roster row, restated on the PLAYER stream: `roster <team> <name>
    ## <lives> <kills>/<deaths>`. Same per-player roster addScoreboard also
    ## draws as visible pixel rows on the separate global/spectator stream
    ## (`/client/global`, "score "-prefixed — see that label's own doc in
    ## global.nim) — restated here as a plain label, no pixel text rendered,
    ## because a human `/client/player` connection (the one a live gameplay
    ## client actually holds) never sees the global stream at all, and a
    ## second socket just to read a scoreboard was rejected as needlessly
    ## doubling the client's heaviest stream.
    ##
    ## `<kills>/<deaths>` here is MATCH-scoped (roster.nim
    ## `matchKillsDeaths`), same source and same reasoning as
    ## `LabelPrefixKd` below — NOT byte-identical to addScoreboard's own
    ## "score" row, which still restates the per-round Player.kills/
    ## Player.deaths (a spectator dashboard concern, out of scope for the
    ## player-HUD fix this field exists for; worth revisiting if that
    ## surface should match).
    ##
    ## `<name>` is DELIBERATELY the anonymous per-team slot identity
    ## (IdentityNames, via `sim.slotIdentityIndex` — the exact scheme
    ## `LabelPrefixIdentity` already uses), NEVER the raw connection address
    ## `addScoreboard`'s own "score" row carries: a player frame is read by
    ## that policy's rivals, and this codebase already polices exactly this
    ## leak (`tests/test_identity_privacy.nim`, "no label in any player's
    ## frame contains a connection address" — caught this label's first
    ## draft red-handed before it shipped). `<team>` is `teamText(team)`,
    ## single-word for all 16 BR colors — deliberately NOT
    ## `playerColorName`/the render-palette name, which has five two-word
    ## entries ("light blue", "pale blue", "dark brown", "dark teal",
    ## "dark navy"). Every field in the tail is therefore a fixed, single
    ## word or a number: a consumer just splits on spaces, no greedy/free
    ## -text backtracking needed (unlike `score`'s raw-address name).
    ## `(<team>, <name>)` uniquely identifies a roster seat, same as an
    ## `identity` badge — cross-reference the two the same way a consumer
    ## already has to.
    ##
    ## HUMAN-WIRE ONLY, same as `LabelPrefixKd`: gated on `not spritesOff`,
    ## so the scripted/policy byte stream is untouched by this marker's
    ## existence — proven, not assumed (see the 240-tick byte/FNV probe this
    ## label's introducing commit cites). One marker per ROSTER SEAT, not per
    ## viewer: every connected player's own stream restates the WHOLE
    ## roster, so a lone `/client/player` socket is enough for a full
    ## scoreboard panel.
  LabelPrefixIdentity* = "identity "
    ## Per-player badge, `identity <color> <name>[ shield][ nade] <weapon>`.
    ## See `labelIdentity` for the ordering invariant. Scan by PREFIX only: the
    ## tail changes every time the wearer picks something up.
  LabelPrefixCogGun* = "cog gun "
    ## The held paintball marker, `cog gun <color>` (board stream only).
  LabelPrefixCogSprayCan* = "cog spray can "
    ## The held spray can, `cog spray can <color>`, which REPLACES the gun
    ## sprite while one is carried — so the silhouette shows the live weapon.
  LabelPrefixGameParams* = "game teams "
    ## The episode-parameter marker, `game teams <count> map <width>x<height>`:
    ## an invisible 1x1 object in the init snapshot stating the match setup
    ## outright — how many teams share the arena (2 or 4) and the exact map
    ## size in map pixels. Before it existed a policy had to INFER both: the
    ## team count from counting room markers or pedestals, the map size from
    ## the walkability sprite's dimensions. Those channels still work; this
    ## label is the stated-value contract for them.
  LabelPrefixOwnAim* = "own aim "
    ## The own-aim readback, `own aim <brads>`: an invisible 1x1 HUD marker on
    ## the PLAYER stream whose label states your own turret angle in brads
    ## (256 per turn, 0 = east, counter-clockwise) as of the rendered tick.
    ## Before this marker existed a policy had to dead-reckon its own aim
    ## open-loop from its rotate inputs — the observation carried no readback
    ## at all, and the accumulated drift measurably cost accuracy (see
    ## docs/PROTOCOL.md, "Your own aim"). NOT named `self aim`: consumers
    ## prefix-match `self ` for the avatar, and a marker sharing that prefix
    ## would false-positive every such scan.
  LabelPrefixEndzone* = "endzone "
    ## The per-team endzone marker,
    ## `endzone <color> <shape> <x0>,<y0> <x1>,<y1>`: an invisible 1x1 object
    ## in the init snapshot stating one team's home capture region outright —
    ## its shape archetype (see the LabelEndzoneShape tokens) and the
    ## inclusive corners of its bounding box in map pixels. One marker per
    ## team in the game — UNLESS the map is flagless (BR N-point spawn
    ## subsystem, CtfMap.flagless): there is no capture geometry to state, so
    ## a flagless episode emits ZERO `endzone ` markers, absence being the
    ## correct signal rather than a fabricated zone nobody scores. CAUTION
    ## for consumers: the broadcast/spectator stream also carries the
    ## endzone glow overlays, `endzone <color> power <n>` — match the third
    ## token against the shape vocabulary (or the `power` literal) before
    ## parsing corners.
  LabelPrefixHandicap* = "handicap "
    ## The per-team handicap marker,
    ## `handicap <color> <permille> hp <n> lives <n> spd <n> miss <n>`: an
    ## invisible 1x1 object in the init snapshot stating one team's authored
    ## handicap fraction AND the resolved gameplay deltas it interpolates to,
    ## so a policy adapts to a weakened (own or enemy) team without knowing
    ## the interpolation formula. One marker per team in the game, emitted
    ## even at permille 0 — absence means an old engine, not "no handicap".
    ## See `labelHandicap` for the exact tail arity.
  LabelPrefixPerks* = "perks "
    ## The per-team perk marker,
    ## `perks <color> <group> [<group> …] mods hp <n> aim <n> nade <n>
    ## spd <n> luck <n> dmg <n>`: an invisible 1x1 object in the init
    ## snapshot stating one team's perk groups outright — each group is the
    ## comma-joined perk names one policy seat carries (`armor,scope`), or
    ## `-` for none — plus, after the fixed `mods` token, the ENGINE-RESOLVED
    ## magnitudes (perkMods), so a policy adapts to tuned mods without
    ## assuming the defaults. One group means the whole team shares it; two
    ## or more deal to the team's distinct policies in join order
    ## (CTF-Doubles). One marker per team in the game, emitted even when
    ## unperked (`perks <color> -`, no mods tail) — absence means an old
    ## engine, not "no perks". See `labelPerks` for the exact format.
  LabelPrefixBarrage* = "grenade barrage depth "
    ## The stated grenade-barrage marker,
    ## `grenade barrage depth <n> rate <n> start <n> sat <n>`: an invisible
    ## 1x1 marker on both streams, present whenever the barrage endgame is
    ## configured (barrageMaxPerSec > 0), stating how deep inside every map
    ## edge the shells currently land (`depth` map px, 0 until the barrage
    ## latches; full board once the escalation completes), the CURRENT
    ## launch rate in grenades/second (`rate`), the clock threshold in
    ## seconds that latches it (`start`), and the seconds from latch to
    ## full saturation (`sat`). Absence means the mode is off (or an old
    ## engine). The shells themselves carry the ordinary grenade labels
    ## (`grenade air`, `blast stage <n>`), so an incoming barrage reads
    ## like any other lob — this marker is the escalation schedule.
  LabelPrefixTrench* = "trench "
    ## One trench's bounding-box marker, `trench <x0>,<y0> <x1>,<y1>`: an
    ## invisible 1x1 object in the init snapshot stating one dug pit's
    ## bounding box outright, in inclusive map-pixel corners — one marker per
    ## entry in `gameMap.trenches`. Before this marker existed, trenches were
    ## invisible to every policy: `LabelWalkabilityMap` is a BINARY mask, and
    ## a trench floor reads identically to open floor on it. Trenches are
    ## stored as `ArenaShape` polygons (a 56x56 walkable pit, its edge cut
    ## with rough noise — see TrenchSize / trenchRoughEdge); the marker states
    ## the shape's tight bounding box, so a non-rect trench reads as slightly
    ## LOOSE (conservative) geometry rather than exact membership. Absent
    ## entirely on 4-team maps (trenches are a 2-team-map feature) and on any
    ## map that rolled zero pits — zero markers, not an empty-box marker. See
    ## `labelTrench` for the exact tail arity.
  LabelPrefixBarrierUp* = "barrier up "
    ## One STANDING cardboard barrier,
    ## `barrier up <x>,<y> f<brads> hp <n>`: the visible half-hex sprite's
    ## own label (not an invisible marker), fog-gated by the barrier's center.
    ## `<x>,<y>` is the placement center in map pixels, `f<brads>` the
    ## placer's aim at placement (0..255, the flat middle side faces that
    ## way, BarrierRadius=24px out), and `hp <n>` the paintball hits it can
    ## still take (starts at 10). The band blocks every PAINT path — gun and
    ## spray — but never sight, movement, or grenades; any cog that drives
    ## into the band flattens it instantly. See `labelBarrierUp` for the
    ## exact tail arity.
  LabelPrefixPuddle* = "puddle "
    ## One paint puddle's bounding-box marker, `puddle <x0>,<y0> <x1>,<y1>`:
    ## an invisible 1x1 object in the init snapshot stating one hazard blob's
    ## bounding box outright, in inclusive map-pixel corners — one marker per
    ## entry in `gameMap.puddles`, same contract as the trench marker above.
    ## Puddles are ORGANIC disc-union splats (see puddleSplatAt), so the box
    ## is slightly loose (conservative) geometry, exactly like a non-rect
    ## trench's marker.
    ## Standing inside rolls a puddleDamagePct (default 20%) chance of 1
    ## damage per full second of continuous occupancy; the puddle never slows
    ## movement or fire and never blocks shots or vision. Absent entirely on
    ## 4-team maps and on any map without puddles (the default) — zero
    ## markers, not an empty-box marker. See `labelPuddle` for the tail arity.
  LabelPrefixZone* = "zone "
    ## The config-gated battle-royale shrink zone's CURRENT rect,
    ## `zone <x0>,<y0> <x1>,<y1>`: an invisible 1x1 object stating the
    ## zone's live bounding box outright, in inclusive map pixels — same
    ## tail contract as the trench/puddle markers above. Re-emitted (and
    ## re-sent) every frame the numbers actually change, since — unlike a
    ## trench or puddle — the rect moves continuously as the zone shrinks.
    ## Standing outside it deals that phase's `dps` per full second of
    ## continuous exposure (the puddle-hazard cadence; see
    ## ZoneDamageRollTicks). Absent entirely when `zonePhases` is empty (the
    ## default) — zero markers, not a full-map box. See `labelZone` for the
    ## tail arity, and `LabelPrefixZoneNext` for the rect it is heading
    ## toward.
  LabelPrefixZoneNext* = "zonenext "
    ## The shrink zone's NEXT (target) rect, `zonenext <x0>,<y0> <x1>,<y1>`:
    ## same grammar and cadence as `LabelPrefixZone`, but stating where the
    ## CURRENT rect is interpolating to — the phase's held rect during a
    ## wait, or that phase's target during a shrink — so a policy can
    ## pre-rotate toward the next safe area before the boundary arrives.
    ## Once every configured phase has resolved, this equals the current
    ## rect (nothing left to move toward). Absent under the same conditions

  ## NOT a sprite label — a WIRE prefix, and here for the same reason
  ## everything else in this file is here: it is a producer/consumer contract
  ## between the engine and a policy whose failure mode is silent.
  ##
  ## A one-page-policy REFLASH rides the 0x86 debug-sprite opcode, which is a
  ## generic byte blob the server already parses, so a reflash needs no wire
  ## change to reach the engine. But that opcode still carries real debug
  ## overlays, and this prefix is the ONLY thing telling the two apart. It was
  ## briefly declared twice — once in `global.nim`'s receive arm, once in
  ## `players/onepage/onepage.nim`'s sender — with nothing tying the copies
  ## together. Editing one would not have failed a build or a test; it would
  ## have made every reflash proposal silently decode as an overlay packet,
  ## and a dropped reflash is an applied-but-unrecorded input, the one thing
  ## determinism cannot survive. One definition, both halves, no drift.
  ##
  ## **The leading byte is load-bearing and must stay outside 0x01..0x06.**
  ## The discrimination is not merely "unlikely to collide", it is impossible
  ## in the forward direction: a debug-sprite payload is parsed by
  ## `parseSpritePacket`, whose only valid leading opcodes are
  ## SpriteMessageSprite/Object/DeleteObject/ClearObjects/Viewport/Layer =
  ## 0x01..0x06, and 'C' is 0x43. No legitimate overlay packet can begin with
  ## this magic. "Improving" the prefix to something starting in that opcode
  ## range would silently reopen the collision — it is the only way this
  ## guarantee can be lost, and nothing else in the code would notice.
  ##
  ## **It is not a label and must never be registered as one.** Unlike
  ## everything above it, this string is never attached to a sprite object,
  ## so it is invisible to the manifest sweep (which is built from a live
  ## frame, not by scanning this file) and it does not belong in
  ## `PolicyScannedLabels` or `tests/label_manifest.txt`. Adding it to
  ## either would fail confusingly, describing a vocabulary the renderer
  ## never emits. It lives here for the ZERO-IMPORTS property and the shared
  ## producer/consumer reach, not because it is part of the observation
  ## schema.
