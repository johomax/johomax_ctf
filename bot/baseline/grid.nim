## The two grids the bot reasons over, and the raycasts that read them.
##
## The first is the pixel walkability mask the server sends down as a sprite:
## one bool per map pixel, walls are exactly the non-walkable pixels. The second
## is the NavCell (8px) lattice eroded from it, which `bot.cellWalkable` holds —
## a cell is open only where the whole player footprint fits. Pixel rays answer
## line of sight and firing lines; the coarse and grid rays trade accuracy for
## the thousands of samples cover scoring and exposure costing need.
