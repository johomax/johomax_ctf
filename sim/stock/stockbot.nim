## Baseline capture-the-flag bot for Coworld CTF (8v8, classic two-flag,
## dense-cover arena, FOG-OF-WAR full-map vision).
##
## Speaks the Bitworld Sprite v1 protocol over a websocket. The observation is
## the FULL map in map coordinates, but entities are fogged: an enemy (and an
## enemy carrying our flag) is only streamed while it sits inside OUR vision —
## a forward cone (half-angle ~60 degrees around our AIM ANGLE, unlimited
## range, walls block) plus a small omnidirectional bubble (~90px). Always
## visible: the static map, BOTH flag pedestals (teammates are fogged too),
## our own flag's state (an empty own pedestal means it is stolen), and
## ourselves via the distinct "self <color> right|left" marker. AIM IS
## DECOUPLED FROM MOVEMENT: a continuous per-player aim angle (0..255 brads,
## 0 = east, counter-clockwise on screen) turns 5 brads per tick while B
## (CCW) or Select (CW) is held; the d-pad never touches it. The aim drives the
## gun, the vision cone, and the sprite flip, so pointing it is THE core
## tactical decision. The bot keeps a persistent world model on top of that:
##
## - **Nav grid**: the full walkability mask arrives once at init; we erode it
##   by the player footprint into an 8px cell grid and run a cost field
##   (Dijkstra) to any goal, then follow the path with waypoint lookahead.
## - **Cover model**: walkable cells adjacent to an obstacle are "cover
##   cells". Cells a remembered enemy could shoot into (range + coarse LOS)
##   get a soft path cost, so movement naturally advances cover-to-cover and
##   keeps obstacles between us and known threats.
## - **Flag model** (two flags): pedestals are STATIC known positions and
##   pedestal flags are never fogged. Only OUR team can carry the enemy flag,
##   but a carried heart is only as visible as its carrier and mates fog like
##   enemies, so the "<enemy color> heart" sprite describes our attack fully
##   only on its pedestal or on ME; a MATE's carry is visible just while that
##   mate is, and an absent enemy heart means a fogged mate has it. Only the
##   enemy can carry OUR heart: the "<my color> heart" sprite on its pedestal
##   means safe, visible off-pedestal is a live thief fix, and ABSENT means
##   stolen by a fogged carrier somewhere between our pedestal and its home
##   edge.
## - **Memory**: visible players are matched to tracks (position, velocity,
##   last-seen tick) that persist through fog, and the last thief fix guides
##   the hunt after the carrier fogs out.
## - **Roles** (deterministic from the per-team seat, 8 seats): a mid QUAD
##   races lanes to the ENEMY pedestal, two flankers route wide and hit the
##   pocket from behind, one overwatch sniper holds a shielded cover post
##   whose peek cell owns the longest firing line over mid — under fog a lane
##   watcher SEES map-wide down its open lane, so overwatch is also the radar
##   — and one home defender guards the choke before our pedestal. The attack
##   wave is deliberately six strong: with no global flag tracking, a carrier
##   that slips the contest is hard to reacquire, so committed offense turns
##   steals into captures. While our flag is stolen the back line hunts the
##   thief along its predicted route toward ITS home edge; attackers press on
##   — captures are instant wins both ways, so the race stays on.
## - **Turret controller**: the bot reads its own aim from the engine's
##   `own aim <brads>` HUD marker each frame, dead-reckoning only BETWEEN
##   frames (each held rotate button turns 5 brads/tick server-side) and as
##   the sole source on pre-marker engines.
##   Each tick it outputs the rotate button that traverses toward the desired
##   aim by the shortest arc, and fires only when the bullet corridor
##   (~14px half-width) covers the target at its range.
## - **Scanning**: units holding a position (overwatch posts, the defender's
##   choke, cooldown ducks) sweep the aim back and forth across the watch arc
##   with genuine rotate-button sweeps, raking the vision cone over it while
##   standing perfectly still. On the move, the aim leads the movement
##   direction when no target demands it, so attackers watch down-lane.
## - **Peek-and-shoot**: the default combat mode. With the gun up and a
##   remembered enemy blocked by a wall, PRE-LAY the aim on the firing line
##   while stepping sideways to the nearest cell that opens it — the shot is
##   ready the moment the ray clears; during the 12-tick cooldown, duck
##   behind the nearest cover that breaks the threat's line and hold there.
## - **Fire discipline**: the bullet is a corridor hitscan along the aim, so
##   the fire gate is geometric: shoot when the aim error's perpendicular
##   miss at the target's range is inside the corridor. Skip targets with a
##   remembered teammate near the fire axis (friendly fire is on; the server
##   kills the NEAREST player in the corridor).
##
## Coordinate model: the map object sits at (0, 0), so object positions ARE
## map coordinates; we find ourselves via the self marker. Only a fresh A
## press fires, and the aim angle locks at the pull (the bullet leaves after
## a short windup), so we stop rotating on the tick we pull.
