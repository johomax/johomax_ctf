# Auto-research ledger

Every experiment the loop has run, in order, with the request ids behind each
verdict. Written by `scripts/autoresearch.py`; see that file for the rules a
verdict is reached under, and README.md for why those are the rules.

A gap is always (treatment - control) and always pooled over both directions of
a mirror that ran at the same moment. "level" means the 95% bootstrap interval
crosses zero, which is a result: it says the change is not worth shipping, not
that the run failed.

The sections below the divider are appended by the loop. Anything above it was
run by hand to set the loop up, and is recorded here for the same reason the
loop records its own: a measured result nobody wrote down gets measured again.

## gen0 — is this tree still the champion?

`jordan-ctf-candidate:v48`, a fresh build of HEAD (`a33fc9b`-era `bot/`),
against the shipped champion `jordan-ctf-candidate:v45`. Both directions,
40 episodes a side, 0 skipped.

- requests: `xreq_b3566f7c`, `xreq_0cfc7db0` (confirmation: `xreq_25697d8d`,
  `xreq_804d8eea`)

| | v48 (tree) | v45 (champion) |
|---|---|---|
| K/D | 0.9887 | 1.0115 |
| kills / deaths | 1749 / 1769 | 1756 / 1736 |
| captures | 13 | 12 |
| wins | 32/80 (40.0%) | 47/80 (58.8%) |

- K/D gap **−0.0228**, 95% CI [−0.0956, +0.0518] — crosses zero
- Win-rate gap **−0.188**, 95% CI [−0.400, **+0.025**] — crosses zero, barely
- Capture gap **+1**, 95% CI [−9, +11] — crosses zero

Nothing separated, but the win-rate interval only just included zero and the
sign was not a side artifact: v45 won on both sides. That is rule 5's case
exactly — an interval that nearly touches zero buys episodes rather than a
verdict — so a confirmation mirror was run and pooled with it.

### Confirmed at n=160: LEVEL

| | v48 (tree) | v45 (champion) |
|---|---|---|
| K/D | 0.9893 | 1.0109 |
| kills / deaths | 3502 / 3540 | 3529 / 3491 |
| captures | 28 | 27 |
| wins | 69/160 (43.1%) | 86/160 (53.8%) |

- K/D gap −0.0216, 95% CI [−0.0697, +0.0272]
- Win-rate gap **−0.106**, 95% CI [−0.256, +0.044]
- Capture gap +1, 95% CI [−14, +15]

The win-rate gap moved **toward** zero as episodes were added, −0.188 to
−0.106, and its interval pulled clear of zero rather than closing on it. That
is what noise does; a real effect resolves the other way. **The tree is level
with the shipped champion**, and this is the fourth time in this repository's
record that a marginal call at 80 episodes has evaporated at 160.

The scare was still worth what it cost. It made the difference between
"beats the tree" and "beats the league" concrete, and the loop gained a
champion gate as a result: screening runs against the tree, because that is
what isolates one variable, but shipping is decided by one more mirror against
the champion. That distinction does not depend on gen0's answer — it becomes
real the moment anything lands in the tree that the league has not seen.

## The refactor arms, created last session and never read

`5814d5e` recorded two request ids for the pre-split/post-split validation and
no verdict. The episodes were already bought, so they were pooled here for
free: **v47 (post-split) vs v46 (pre-split), 80 episodes, 0 skipped.**

- K/D gap −0.0615, 95% CI [−0.1285, +0.0045]
- Win-rate gap −0.062, 95% CI [−0.275, +0.150]
- Capture gap +1, 95% CI [−10, +11]

All three cross zero. The split is not measurably a regression, and a
line-level comparison agrees: normalising export markers and the locals that
became `Frame` fields, the pre-split file loses 22 lines against the modules
and every one of them is an import, a `let`/`var` block keyword, or a
declaration that moved into the `Frame` type. No logic line is missing, and
1 of 89 shared procs differs — `decide`, which became the stage dispatcher.

So the split is clean. Between the shipped champion and this tree that leaves
the fold (`0a3e922`) and `f590681`, neither measured against v45 — and with
gen0 confirming level at n=160, neither needs to be: whatever they changed,
the sum of it is not separable from the champion.

`f590681` is still worth one experiment on its own merits. GV25 made the
respawn ground a zone, so the single virtual threat at the enemy pedestal
became `EnemyRespawnSamples` points down their endzone column, and three
permanent threats cost more ground than one. That is a routing change nobody
has measured in either direction. `respawnsamples1` asks it.

- rationale: `f590681` replaced the single virtual threat at the enemy pedestal with three samples down their endzone column, to match GV25 making the respawn ground a zone rather than a point. The geometry is right and the routing consequence has never been measured in either direction: three permanent threats cost more ground than one, and this repository's one standing finding about perception is that every intel addition made the bot more timid and deaths rose. One sample is the pre-GV25 behaviour on the post-GV25 code path, which asks the timidity question without reopening the geometry one.

- rationale: Past LatePushTick a draw is the default outcome, so the posts break and everything commits to the capture. A draw scores as badly as a loss and the game hard-stops at 5000, so 3400 leaves 1600 ticks of all-in play. Starting 400 ticks earlier buys another capture attempt at the cost of holding the line longer.

- rationale: The unstick burst is gated `stuckTicks > 20 and engage < 0`, so while a target is held the burst is disabled and anything that pins the bot keeps it pinned for the rest of the fight. This is the second of the two causes of staring contests identified in the archive and the only one never touched. Letting the burst fire while engaged after 60 pinned ticks trades a settled aim for movement, and 60 ticks is long enough that a legitimate hold-and-shoot never reaches it.

## holdline4 — PROMOTE (shipped as jordan-ctf-candidate:v57)

`HoldLineKills` 6 -> 4: the wave commits forward after four enemy deaths
instead of six. The first change this loop has shipped, and the only one of
fifteen experiments to survive a confirmation.

**Five separately-bought samples, and what each cost to learn:**

| sample | n | K/D gap |
|---|---|---|
| screen 1 (build v49, under the first screen rule) | 80 | +0.0295 |
| screen 2 (rebuild v57, under the z-scaled rule) | 80 | +0.0341 |
| confirmation alone | 160 | ~ +0.040 |
| extension alone | 158 | ~ +0.028 |
| **pooled** | **398** | **+0.0343, CI [+0.0009, +0.0672]** |

Win rate leaned positive in every one (+7.5, +11.3, +8.3, +8.8 points) and
separated in none. Captures never separated at any n.

**Champion gate: PASS.** v57 against the shipped champion v45, 80 episodes,
both directions: K/D +0.0034 CI [-0.0671, +0.0712], win rate -0.013, captures
+0 -- level on all three, which is the bar. The three measurements are
mutually consistent: gen0 put v48 at v45 - 0.022, this puts v57 at v48 +
0.034, predicting v57 = v45 + 0.012 against a measured +0.0034.

Requests: `xreq_17c7ab5c`, `xreq_5a18d8f4` (screen), `xreq_7b1f5e64`,
`xreq_96455067` (confirm), `xreq_d0bf0c75`, `xreq_cf34e5e9` (extend),
`xreq_fa5f375d`, `xreq_db4d9519` (champion gate). Submission
`sub_06dc828c-c565-4da2-bb62-69c9ffbcd95d`; the server promoted it to champion
and benched v45.

**What to distrust here.** The interval clears zero by 0.0009, and it took
three looks at the same comparison to get there -- optional stopping inflates
the true type-I error above the nominal 5%. The SIZE is soft. What is not soft
is the sign: four independently purchased samples ran +0.028 to +0.040 without
wandering, and a spurious effect wanders. Read this as "a real improvement of
roughly +0.03 K/D, possibly less", not as a measured +0.0343.

## The three that did not survive their own screens

Recorded because the pattern is the point: a striking screen is not a result,
and the confirmation stage exists to say so.

| experiment | screen | confirmation | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `latepush3000` | +0.016 K/D, **+11.3** pts wins, +4 caps | re-screened +0.015, **+3.7** pts, 0 caps | level |
| `exposedcost10` | **+0.060** K/D, **+22.5** pts, +8 caps | +0.017 [-0.025, +0.060], +9.2 pts, +15 caps | level |
| `holdline4` | +0.030 K/D, +7.5 pts | held at +0.034 over 398 | **shipped** |

`exposedcost10` was the strongest screen of the session and halved under
confirmation. `latepush3000`'s win-rate lean, which looked like the most
promising signal of the early runs, came back at a third of its size on an
independent rebuild.

Its captures are worth one line of honesty: +15 with CI [+0, +31] at 240
episodes is the most capture-positive result recorded here, and this loop
cannot act on it. Captures turn on tens of events and cannot be resolved at
any sample size worth buying, so they only ever veto. If loosened routing
really does buy captures, this design is blind to it.

## What the constants say so far

Three of them are now bracketed on both sides, which is worth more than any
single verdict:

- `EnemyRespawnSamples` = 3 is a local optimum: 1 measures -0.058, 5 measures
  +0.005. The GV25 repair in `f590681`, never measured when it landed, is
  earning its routing cost.
- `LeadTicks` = 6 is fine: 8.0 measures -0.034, 4.0 measures +0.000.
- `HoldLineKills` moved 6 -> 4 (above). Its follow-up at 2 is queued.

And a coherent story across three rejects: the bot's aim-and-vision budget is
tight and must not be spent more freely (`preaimarc28` +8 brads of pre-aim
licence: -0.061; `respawnsamples1` fewer remembered threats: -0.058), while
its routing caution may be overpriced (`exposedcost10`: +0.060 on the screen,
+0.017 confirmed). Aim and routing are separable resources. Nobody told the
loop that; it fell out of the sweep.

- rationale: Corner grenades refill every 5s and are the densest pickup on the map by an order of magnitude (~80 a match against ~7 of everything else), and grenades ignore walls, cover and teams alike. A flanker will currently detour 340px to arm; the supply says the detour is cheap.

- rationale: At 1 hp a heal outranks the current errand only within 180px. Two kits sit on the centre line and refill every 30s, and a one-hit bot is worth a fraction of a full one in every fight it then takes; 240 lets it break off from further out.

  - `jordan-ctf-candidate:v68`: K/D 0.9966 (1767/1773), captures 14, wins 41
- rationale: A grenade is the only weapon that collects value from a place rather than a body, and the only one cover does nothing against, but a spot the sonar heard a fight at stops being a throw target after 45 ticks. Landings are audible map-wide through walls and fog, so this is the bot's one map-wide sense and the throw is its one map-wide answer; 90 ticks is still inside SonarTtl.
