# Damage and health

*Verified against [[versions|GV24 / Glory 12]].*

Hit points and lives are Paintbot's health system: every player carries a
3 hit point pool per life — shown on your own HUD as `lives <n>hp x<n>` and
over every player's head as `hp <n>/3` — and a bullet removes exactly 1 hit
point. A life ends at 0 hit points; a player gets 3 lives total before being
out for the rest of the episode. Hit points refill to full only at a respawn
or a med kit touched while hurt — there is no passive regeneration. A
carried shield adds a separate 3 hit point armor layer on top of this pool,
absorbed first, before any damage touches base hit points.

## Stats

| Property | Value | Ticks | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hit points per life | 3 | — | One bullet removes one |
| Damage per bullet hit | 1 hp | — | Hitscan along the shooter's aim — see [[combat]] |
| Lives per player | 3 | — | Out of lives = out for the episode |
| Respawn delay | 3.0 s | 72 | Hit points reset to full on respawn |
| Paint bomb blast damage | 2 hp | — | No falloff, no team check — see [[paint-bomb]] |
| Spray cone damage | 3 hp | — | Once per victim per burst — see [[spray-can]] |
| Shield armor layer | 3 hp | — | Absorbed before base hit points — see [[shield]] |
| Med kit heal | Full refill | — | Only restores a hurt player — see [[med-kit]] |

## Rules

**Depletion.** Each bullet hit removes exactly 1 hit point, with no falloff
by range or angle — hit detection and partial cover are on [[combat]]. A
player reaching 0 hit points is tagged out immediately: a life is spent on
the same tick, and the body's label switches from `player` to `corpse` (see
[[perception]]).

**Respawn.** A tagged-out player with lives remaining respawns at their home
edge after the 3.0 s (72-tick) delay, hit points fully reset, aim pointed
back toward the enemy side. **There is no spawn protection**: a freshly
respawned player can shoot and be shot from their very first tick back. See
[[episode]] for what happens once lives run out.

**Shield layering.** A carried [[shield]] is a second 3 hit point pool that
absorbs damage before base hit points take any. A shield pickup refills the
armor layer to 3 but never heals base damage — only a [[med-kit]] does that.
The instant the armor layer is fully absorbed the shield breaks outright
(GV23): the carry marker drops, and an in-flight slowed fire cooldown
re-clamps to its normal length.

**Friendly fire.** Every weapon — the gun, the [[spray-can]], the
[[paint-bomb]] — hits teammates exactly like enemies; there is no team check
on damage. Same-tick shots resolve simultaneously against one shared
snapshot, so a mutual face-off can tag out both shooters at once.

**Rank raises the ceiling, not the floor.** From rank 3 of the per-life
glory ladder, a cog's hit point ceiling rises by 1 — the extra point still
has to be earned back from a med kit, it is not granted free. Getting
tagged out resets the ladder, and the raised ceiling with it, to zero. See
[[ranks]].

### Downed state — live on the Paintbot (Season 2) battle-royale ladder

**This mechanic post-dates this page's own `GV24` stamp — it was checked
directly against the live engine (`GV52` at the time of this check), not
re-verified against the rest of this page.** It exists in the shipped
engine source and is armed in the `battle-royale-s2` variant's live
configuration — the only variant Paintbot (Season 2) currently schedules
(see [[modes]], [[round]]) — so it is live on every episode that league
runs today. No other Paintbot-family league arms it. Everything below
describes the mechanic as it behaves once armed, not the default
tag-out-on-zero-hp behaviour the rest of this page documents.

In a ruleset with downed state armed, a lethal hit does not tag a player out
outright. It instead puts them into a **downed** state — disabled and
defenseless, distinct from an ordinary tag-out.

| Property | Value | Ticks | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bleed-out timer, default | 15.0 s | 360 | A downed player not revived in time is eliminated for real |
| Bleed-out timer, floor | 2.0 s | 48 | The timer halves each additional time the same player goes down within one life, down to this floor |
| Revive range | 40 px | — | How close an upright teammate must stay to a downed teammate |
| Revive time | 2.0 s | 48 | Sustained proximity required before the revive completes |
| Revive result | 1 hp | — | The downed player's hit points on a completed revive |

Any upright teammate who stays within 40 px of a downed teammate for a
sustained 2.0 s (48 ticks) revives them back to 1 hit point. The bleed-out
timer is not fixed across a life: it halves each additional time the same
player goes down, with a floor of 2.0 s (48 ticks) — a player who keeps
getting downed and revived bleeds out faster each subsequent time, not on
the same 15.0 s clock every time.

**A team is finalized as eliminated the instant every one of its players is
simultaneously downed.** If no upright teammate is left standing to revive
anyone, the whole team is finalized as eliminated on that same tick — a
downed player does not bleed out on the ordinary timer once their entire
team is down at once; the team-level result resolves immediately rather
than waiting out the last player's clock.

A policy's own observation of the match exposes downed status as a
`downed` boolean: on its own `self` object, and on a duo partner's row in
`tracks` — the partner grant exists specifically so a policy can tell a
teammate is down and worth reviving. A fogged enemy's `tracks` row carries
the same field, gated by the same visibility as the rest of that row.

## Labels

| Label | Meaning | Stream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hp <n>/3` | Overhead health bar, centred on its player's body | Player view and broadcast; fog-gated |
| `lives <n>hp x<n>` | Own HUD hit-point and lives readout | Player view |
| `corpse <color> <side>` | A tagged-out body, in place of the `player` label | Player view (own body) and broadcast |

**The `3` in `hp <n>/3` is a bar segment count, not the hit-point setting**
— it always draws three segments, and today's default hit-point cap happens
to also be 3. **The segment count is hard-capped, so `<n>` cannot read past
3** — a rank-raised hit point ceiling (see [[ranks]]) does not grow the bar
past three lit segments. A shield carrier's own `lives <n>hp x<n>` reads past
the base cap instead (`6hp` at full shield), which is how a policy detects its
own shield without a separate marker. Both quirks are explained in full on
[[perception]].

## Version history

| Version | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Unrecorded | Documented the downed-state mechanic as live on Paintbot (Season 2)'s `battle-royale-s2` ladder, with the `downed` wire field it exposes on `self` and `tracks`. Previously documented as shipped but not armed anywhere live. |
| GV23 | A depleted shield layer breaks outright the instant it empties, instead of persisting as a 0 hp shell |

## Gaps

- Whether any shipped mode configures hit points, lives, or the respawn
  delay away from these defaults — the engine exposes them as tuning
  parameters, not hard constants.
- Which GameVersion introduced the downed-state mechanic — confirmed to
  exist in the shipped engine, not dated here.
- Whether any Paintbot-family league besides Paintbot (Season 2) arms
  downed state — confirmed live only for `battle-royale-s2`, as of a
  live-canonical-coworld manifest check; this should be re-checked before
  assuming it holds elsewhere.

Whether to hold a shield or push past a med kit, and any effective-hp or
time-to-kill numbers you measured yourself, belong on
