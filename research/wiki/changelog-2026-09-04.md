# Changelog — 2026-09-04

*Covers changes that went live 2026-09-04, spanning builds 0.7.317–0.7.320 (GV24 / Glory 13) plus two Observatory-side fixes on the League Leaders panel — including a same-day scoring incident on the win multiplier below, caught and rolled back before the day was out.*

Seven things changed for players on Paintbot (Season 2) today. This is the first of a daily series — see [[changelog]] for the running archive. Anything here that's strategy-relevant also lives on [[patch-notes]] in that page's own engine-versioned form; this page is written for a faster, plainer read, and is the one worth sharing.

## Rules

### Standings

- **Standings now reward form, not a lucky round.** Paintbot (Season 2)'s standing switched from an entrant's single best round ever to a live, decaying rated average — recent play counts for more than one great round from weeks back. Live since round 3856; the whole round history was replayed through the new formula, nothing was reset. See [[elo]].
- **League Leaders is reporting again.** All four tiles had been frozen on a single snapshot from 2026-08-26 — 8.7 days stale — after the reporter behind the panel lost the route it used to list a round's episodes and failed silently for over a week. A repointed reporter came back online today; its first successful run landed 03:05:55Z, with 14 runs completed since, the newest on round 3878. Point Machine and Untouchable have already moved to reflect a policy that only exists post-recut; Most Lethal and The Closer haven't moved yet, because nothing has beaten their pre-freeze marks — expect those two to catch up as fresh rounds land, not to jump immediately.
- **League Leaders' big numbers read cleanly now.** Every chip on the panel — kills/seat, deaths/seat, score/seat — formats a large score compactly instead of printing every digit: Point Machine currently reads `61.5K`, not a six-digit number. Live now.

### Battle Royale

- **Duo teams can see more of the field.** A policy can now see item pickups on the ground, its own loadout, and its duo partner's held items — tracked by the game all along, but invisible to a policy until today. Live since round 3854. See [[perception]].
- **The ring's damage follows the paint, not a box.** Zone damage inside the closing ring now follows the actually-painted surface rather than a rectangle, and a downed player standing on paint bleeds out at 2x the normal rate. Live since round 3857 (build 0.7.319). See [[damage-and-health]].
- **Winning pays the whole team, and losing still banks something — though the win multiplier itself had a rough first day.** A Battle Royale win started the day as a flat x4 multiplier folded into the winning team's whole Glory total at finalize, replacing the old flat bonus deed; losing teams keep and bank their real Glory total instead of banking nothing for coming up short. Two new team-play deeds armed alongside it: Tag Back, for reviving a teammate, and Joint Act, for a close-together assist. Live since round 3871 (build 0.7.320). **The x4 multiplier itself was rolled back later the same day — see "The scoring incident" below.** See [[glory-season-2|Glory (Season 2)]].
- **The items on the ground now look like items.** Marker halves, hoppers, and bandages had been spawning in every match without a sprite; they now render as recognizable pickups. A marker and a hopper together arm one working gun; a carried bandage (cap 3) self-applies +1 hp after a few quiet seconds. Live since round 3871 (build 0.7.320). See [[modes]].

### The scoring incident

- **A revive loop briefly broke the scoreboard, and it's fixed.** The x4 win multiplier above was live for a stretch of the day before a duo found they could chain their own downs and revives inside the closing ring's paint — each revive minted the new Tag Back deed again, and because Season 2's Glory economy multiplies rather than adds, 24-27 revives in one match compounded into scores in the trillions, four to seven orders of magnitude past the format's own 28,311,552-point design ceiling. Eleven rounds carried at least one inflated match before the fix landed: 3885 (the first), 3894, 3897, 3900, 3901, 3904, 3917, 3920, 3921, 3936, and 3938.
- **The fix, and what it means for the board.** The x4 win multiplier is rolled back (commit `d595f300`); wins are priced the way they were before today's change again, through the restored Victory deed. All eleven affected rounds are excluded from standings and from the platform's records, and the board has been recomputed clean. The legitimate all-time high stands exactly where it did before any of this: 3,375,440, from round 3860, credited to `eckstar-paintbot-s2-bounding:v1`. Clean play resumed at round 3953, the first round played on the rollback build.
- **Two players found this before we did, and it's worth saying so.** Solbiati Alessandro posted the first mega-score off his own row, then did the harder thing: he diffed his own seat's decision log from the jackpot match against an ordinary one from the same round and reported, against his own interest, that his policy hadn't done anything differently between them — "my policy did not do anything in the second case that it failed to do in the first." David Bloomin factored the number itself straight from the digits — 677,830,887,554,400 = 2^5 · 3^25 · 5^2 — used it to show the wiki's own design-ceiling claim no longer held, and raised it to us rather than editing the page himself. Thank you both. A future re-arming of the x4 multiplier is expected, behind two more fixes: no reviving while standing in the ring's damaging paint, and a per-episode cap on how many times a single deed can mint.
