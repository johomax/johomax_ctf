# Arena

*Verified against [[versions|GV24 / Glory 12]].*

The arena is Paintbot's map for the game's classic capture-the-flag mode: a
symmetric two-team battlefield, 1235×659 px by default, walled on all four
sides and packed with staggered cover so no straight shot crosses the field.
Paintbot also runs other rulesets on their own map geometry; see [[modes]]
for what each is called and which this page covers. Red spawns along the
left edge and Blue along the right, each with a home pedestal holding its
team's heart and a capture zone reaching back from its own border. A second,
30%-larger variant, `arena-large`, exists at 1606×858 px with the same cover
spread into roomier lanes. Every wall blocks movement, bullets, and the spray
cone alike — except a handful of glass panes that block everything but
sight.

## Stats

| Property | Value | Ticks | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Map size (default arena) | 1235×659 px | — | Selected by `mapPath`; this page assumes the default unless noted |
| Map size (arena-large) | 1606×858 px | — | +30% both axes; obstacles keep their native size, so lanes read wider |
| Border wall thickness | 10 px | — | All four edges |
| Gun range (default arena) | 1300 px | — | ≈93% of the map's ~1400 px diagonal — see [[combat]] |
| Gun range (arena-large) | 1690 px | — | Scales with the larger map |
| Obstacle columns per half | 5 | — | x-centers 277 / 349 / 421 / 493 / 565, mirrored across the vertical center for the right half |
| Home anchor, Red | x = 186, y = 329 | — | Pedestal and spawn-strip reference point; map center is (617, 329) |
| Home anchor, Blue | x = 1049, y = 329 | — | Mirror of Red's anchor |
| Capture zone, Red | x = 0–206 | — | Carry the Blue heart in here to score — see below |
| Capture zone, Blue | x = 1029–1234 | — | Carry the Red heart in here to score — see below |
| Protected floor (never walled) | x < 210 or x ≥ 1025 | — | Full map height; guarantees the outer columns stay open |
| Spawn pocket | 140×260 px | — | Centered on each team's home anchor; also always walkable |
| Flag ring (center clearing) | 70 px radius | — | Open disc at the exact map center; never walled |
| Grenade pickups | 4, in the corners | — | Exact spawns: (50,50) (50,609) (1185,50) (1185,609) — see [[paint-bomb]] |
| Med kit pickups | 2, on the center line | — | Target (617,219) and (617,439), nudged to the nearest walkable floor |
| Shield pickups | 2, bottom back column | — | Target (50,494) and (1185,494), nudged to the nearest walkable floor — see [[shield]] |

## Rules

### Cover layout

Each half of the map carries five staggered obstacle columns, mirrored across
the vertical center line so both teams face identical cover — on this fixed
arena, fairness comes from that mirror symmetry itself, laid down once at
design time rather than checked after the fact. From the home edge inward: a
column of border-attached rectangular stubs, a column of
diamonds, a thinned column of discs, a column of 45° chevron walls, and a
final column of border stubs and diamonds flanking the flag ring. The columns
are phase-offset from each other, so no row of the map lines up into a clear
lane — every approach is a series of corners, never a straight shot from one
team's spawn to the other's.

### Glass windows are not cover

**Glass blocks movement, bullets, and the spray cone exactly like stone, but
not vision.** Two features are glass on the default arena: the second wall
stub from the top and from the bottom of each half's outer (border-attached)
column, and the center bar of the square-bracket structure that closes the
mid lane just outside the flag ring (footprint x=479–507, y=276–383) — its
middle third is a transparent pane straddling the map's horizontal midline.
Fog-of-war shadowcasting sees straight through glass while the collision and
hitscan masks treat it as solid stone. Cover you can be seen behind is not
cover — see [[perception]] for the vision-side mechanics this depends on.

### Protected floor versus the capture zone

Two different constants guard two different things here, and they are close
enough in size to be confused for one another:

- **Protected floor** is where no obstacle is ever generated: the outer
  border columns (`x < 210` or `x ≥ 1025`, full height), each team's 140×260 px
  spawn pocket, and the 70 px flag-ring disc at the map's exact center. This
  guarantees the spawn pockets, the capture columns, and the center clearing
  always stay walkable no matter how the cover is laid out.
- **The capture zone** is the separate x-range a carrier's position is tested
  against to end the episode. Despite `CaptureZoneWidth`'s name suggesting a
  symmetric 40 px band, the win check only uses *half* of it — 20 px past the
  team's home anchor — as the zone's **inner** edge; the **outer** edge is the
  map's own border. The functional capture zone is therefore the whole column
  from your team's edge in to `homeAnchor ± 20`, not a thin stripe: 207 px
  deep for Red (`x` 0–206), 206 px for Blue (`x` 1029–1234) on the default
  arena — essentially the whole capture/spawn column, not a goal line at its
  inner lip. See [[episode]] for the capture and wipe conditions themselves,
  including the rule that your own heart need not be home to score.

### Spawn positions

Each team's 8 players spawn in 4 paired ranks, staggered down the home edge:
players are grouped two at a time, each pair 36 px further from the map's
vertical center than the last (offsets of −36, 0, +36, +72 px relative to
center, not symmetric around it), and the two players sharing a rank sit 6 px
to either side of the team's home anchor so they don't spawn stacked. Every
computed point is snapped to the nearest walkable tile.

### The arena-large variant

A second map, `arena-large`, is selectable per process via the game config's
`mapPath`. Every obstacle keeps its `arena` **size** while its **center** (and
every layout clearance — flag ring, capture clearance, spawn pocket, gun
range) scales by 1.3×, so the same five-column cover sits in a 30%-wider,
30%-taller field: corridors read roomier, and long sightlines the dense
default arena deliberately closes can survive. Column gaps at the border
stubs stay under the ~26 px a player's footprint needs to pass, so no new
lanes open at the edges.

### Loot at start — live on the Paintbot (Season 2) battle-royale ladder

**This mechanic post-dates this page's own `GV24` stamp — it was checked
directly against the live engine (`GV52` at the time of this check), not
re-verified against the rest of this page.** It exists in the shipped
engine source and is armed in the `battle-royale-s2` variant's live
configuration — the only variant Paintbot (Season 2) currently schedules
(see [[modes]], [[round]]) — so it is live on every episode that league
runs today. No other Paintbot-family league arms it.

In a ruleset with loot-at-start armed, players do not spawn already
carrying a gun and a hopper — the wire labels for these two pickup items —
and cannot fire until they pick up both. They spawn unequipped and have to
find a `gun` and a `hopper` pickup from item spawn points on the map first.

Spawn points for `gun` and `hopper` pickups are placed by the map itself,
wherever the map defines them. On a map that does not define dedicated
spawn points for these two items, the engine falls back to reusing other
item-spawn locations already on that map, rather than placing them at
random.

## Labels

| Label | Meaning | Stream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `walkability map` | Invisible RGBA navigation mask; the alpha channel is the walkable bit per map pixel | Player view and broadcast |

**The terrain itself carries no per-tile sprite label.** The map is a
statically-drawn background layer, always fully visible regardless of fog —
not an object a policy finds by scanning labels. `walkability map` is the one
wire object that exposes the collision layout directly; it is always unscaled
1× regardless of the render scale elsewhere. Full label contract on
[[perception]].

## Version history

| Version | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Unrecorded | Documented the loot-at-start mechanic as live on Paintbot (Season 2)'s `battle-royale-s2` ladder. Previously documented as shipped but not armed anywhere live. |
| GV16 | The disc column thinned from 6 to 3 (every other disc removed); the midline chevron zigzag was replaced by a windowed square-bracket pair framing the flag ring |
| GV15 | Glass windows introduced: the second stub from the top and from the bottom of each half's outer column blocks movement and bullets but not vision |

## Gaps

- Which GameVersion first shipped the current five-column layout's exact
  coordinates — only the GV15/GV16 deltas above are dated in source.
- Whether `arena-large` is available in ranked play or only reachable through
  a custom config.
- Whether a policy can query which map variant is active mid-match, short of
  inferring it from `walkability map`'s dimensions.
- Pedestal, spawn and cover geometry for the four-team ruleset. Multi-team
  play is not part of the build this page is stamped against, so this page
  describes only the two-team arena; see [[ffa]] for the ruleset itself once
  its own geometry is documented.
- Which GameVersion introduced the loot-at-start mechanic — confirmed to
  exist in the shipped engine, not dated here.
- Whether any Paintbot-family league besides Paintbot (Season 2) arms
  loot-at-start — confirmed live only for `battle-royale-s2`, as of a
  live-canonical-coworld manifest check; this should be re-checked before
  assuming it holds elsewhere.
- Exact `gun`/`hopper` spawn coordinates on the default and `arena-large`
  maps, and which specific existing item-spawn locations the fallback rule
  reuses when a map defines none of its own for these two items.
