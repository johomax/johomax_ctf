# Ranks

*Verified against [[versions|GV24 / Glory 12]].*

A rank is a cog's per-life level, 0 through 5, driven by XP — a currency
separate from [[glory]] that a cog earns for itself within a single life and
forfeits completely on death. Five cumulative XP thresholds gate ranks 1
through 5, and each one crossed buys a small bundle of combat buffs: faster
windup, bonus hit points, faster fire cooldown, a faster spray-cone reset,
and — at max rank — a waived carrier speed tax. The
chrome name for the ladder's six steps, lowest to highest, is `recruit`,
`tagger`, `marksman`, `ironhide`, `quickdraw`, `legend`.

### Buffs by rank

The buff table is the mechanic layer: six separate integer arrays, one per
rank, that change combat numbers directly. Every value below is causal — it
enters the replay hash the same way a hit-point or a windup tick does.

| Rank | Chrome name | Windup Δ | Gun range | Bonus HP | Fire cooldown | Spray reset | Grenade charges | Carrier speed tax |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | recruit | 0 | 100% | +0 | 100% | 100% | 1 | Not waived |
| 1 | tagger | −1 | 100% | +0 | 100% | 100% | 1 | Not waived |
| 2 | marksman | −1 | 100% | +0 | 100% | 60% | 1 | Not waived |
| 3 | ironhide | −1 | 100% | +1 | 100% | 60% | 1 | Not waived |
| 4 | quickdraw | −1 | 100% | +1 | 75% | 60% | 2 | Not waived |
| 5 | legend | −2 | 100% | +1 | 75% | 60% | 2 | Waived |

**Rank 2's chrome name, "marksman", already collides with an unrelated
achievement tier of the same name on [[achievements]].** A future rename of
either one would silently create or destroy that collision, and nothing
would flag it — check both lists before renaming either.

**Windup Δ is ticks off the base fire windup**, not a percentage or any other
unit — a negative value shortens the pull by that many ticks, so rank 1 trims
one tick and rank 5 trims two, matching [[combat]]'s own windup numbers.
**Fire cooldown and spray reset are percentages of the baseline duration** —
lower is faster, not a probability. **Gun range is flat 100% at every
rank.** An earlier bonus step at high rank was retired in Glory 6 by
flattening its per-rank range-multiplier table to 100% across the board.
**The range calculation itself is not dead** — it still runs on every shot,
at every rank, multiplying the base range by that table's entry — but
multiplying by 100% changes nothing, so the buff has no observable effect
today. This is a different failure mode from **grenade charges**, the same
rank table's other neutered column: that value — 1 for ranks 0–3, 2 for
ranks 4–5 — is never read at all. The throw path clears a carried
[[paint-bomb|paint bomb]] after exactly one throw at every rank regardless
of this value, so grenade charges is genuinely dead code, not merely
neutralized data. The item-side detail is on [[paint-bomb]].

**That dead value still reaches the screen, and this is the trap worth
knowing.** Selecting a rank-4 or rank-5 cog on the broadcast opens a card
listing that cog's buffs, and the card prints a second grenade charge for
both ranks — read straight off this same unused column, in plain text,
with nothing on screen marking it as inert. Two independent readers of that
card each concluded a rank-4 cog gets two grenade throws, simply by
believing what an authoritative-looking card told them. It is wrong: every
rank throws exactly one paint bomb per pickup, full stop — see
[[paint-bomb]]. Until that card is fixed, its grenade-charge line is the
least trustworthy fact a viewer can read off the broadcast.

**Carrier speed tax
waived** removes the movement penalty a heart carrier normally pays, only at
rank 5 — see [[movement]].

At rank 3 a cog's hit point ceiling rises by one, but the `hp <n>/3` overhead
readout does not grow past 3 lit segments to show it — the bar's segment count
is hard-capped (see [[damage-and-health]]). A carried [[shield]] instead pushes
a HUD readout past baseline on the separate own-view `lives <n>hp x<n>` label,
to `6hp`. See [[perception]] for the label.

## Rules

**Rank resets to zero the instant a cog dies.** The reset fires at the exact
moment of death and zeroes XP, rank, and every per-life counter tied to it,
including the supply-drop credit and count below. A ranked-up cog carries
none of it into its next life — the buffs in the table above have to be
re-earned from rank 0 every respawn. This is a **per-life** ladder, not a
per-episode or per-career one; the same reset also runs once at the start of
a new game.

**A team's Glory scoreboard is untouched by a rank reset.**
Ranks and Glory are two separate ledgers on two separate schedules: a rank
dies with its cog, but a team's banked Glory survives every individual death
in the episode. See [[glory]] and [[scoring]] for the ledger that does not
reset here.

**A friendly-fire kill also de-levels the killer, mid-life, with no death
required.** Killing a teammate costs the killer 20 XP on top of whatever it
costs the team's Glory ledger — XP cannot go below 0, and the killer's rank
is re-evaluated against the thresholds above immediately, so a bad friendly
kill can knock the killer back a rank on the spot. This is a **third**,
separate consequence of one act, distinct from both of the other two: the
Glory penalty prices the team's scoreboard, this XP penalty prices the
killer's own rank ladder, and neither is the ordinary death-triggered reset
above, which only fires when the killer's own cog dies — not when it kills.
See [[glory]] for the Glory-side penalty on the same act.

**Crossing a threshold pays power, not Glory.** Ranking up mints **0 Glory
and 0 drama** — it fires the same deed-accounting path as every other award
(so it is still counted for audit purposes) but the payout is zero, and the
generic "+N glory" pop is explicitly suppressed for it so no empty toast
appears. What actually happens on screen is a dedicated `RANK UP` pop with one
asterisk per rank reached — a celebration that carries no payout. What the
rank-up genuinely buys is everything in the buffs table above, plus Ace status
at rank 3.

**Ace rank (3) turns on supply drops.** From rank 3, a cog gets a visual
ember-plume marker and its team's heart begins producing supply-drop
pickups — rate-gated to one drop per 20 new XP earned, at least 90 ticks
(3.75 s) apart, capped at 4 drops per life. A dropped pickup is
indistinguishable from an ordinary one in a player's own view; see
[[perception]]. Reaching Ace rank is also the gate for one
[[achievements|achievement]] tier — see [[achievements]].

**The kit a supply drop produces is not a roll — it is a fixed, deterministic
cycle.** A cog's first supply drop in a life is always a med kit, the second
a grenade, the third a spray can, and the fourth — the last one the per-life
cap allows — a shield. The cycle never wraps back to med kit within a single
life, because the cap and the cycle length are both four. A policy that
tracks its own drop count for a cog therefore knows exactly what kit the next
drop will be before it lands.

**Mechanic and chrome, kept separate on purpose.** The thresholds and the six
buff arrays above are the mechanic: stable, causal, integer values that a
policy's outcomes actually depend on. The six rank names are chrome: a single
display-string table with no gameplay effect of its own, read only for the
feed, the log, and the HUD. Because the split is real in the code, not just in
this page's layout, the numbers above hold regardless of what the display
names are — see [[conventions]] for the general rule.

## Version history

| Version | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Wiki | Flagged a rename trap: rank 2's chrome name "marksman" collides with an unrelated achievement tier of the same name on [[achievements]]. |
| Wiki | Documented that the broadcast's own inspector card shows a second grenade charge for rank 4 and rank 5, read from the same dead value this page already flags — and that the charge does not exist. |
| Wiki | Corrected the gun-range buff row: the Glory 6 retirement zeroed the per-rank multiplier table, not the code — the range calculation still runs on every shot. See [[combat]] for the same correction. |
| Wiki | This page's ladder "rungs" renamed to "steps" — a name collision with unrelated incoming play-vocabulary, avoided here rather than after it ships. |
| Glory 10 | Rank-up payout 6 Glory / 5 drama → 0 / 0. Ranking up stopped paying Glory. |
| Glory 6 | A gun-range bonus at high rank was retired by flattening its per-rank multiplier table to 100%; the range calculation that reads the table remains live code, run on every shot. |
