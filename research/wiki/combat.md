# Combat

*Verified against [[versions|GV24 / Glory 12]].*

Firing is a three-stage act: pull the trigger, wait out a 5-tick (0.21 s)
windup with your aim already locked, then release a hitscan shot along that
locked angle. A 12-tick (0.5 s) cooldown follows every release, and the gun
reaches out to 1300 px — effectively the whole default map. Hit resolution
has **zero randomness**: a shot either crosses a deterministic 8 px-wide
corridor with a clear line of sight to its target's exposed silhouette, or it
does not. There is no accuracy roll anywhere in the chain.

## Stats

| Property | Value | Ticks | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fire windup | 0.21 s | 5 | Trigger pull to release; aim locks at the pull |
| Fire cooldown | 0.5 s | 12 | Starts at release, not at the pull; a pull is refused outright while it runs |
| Cooldown, shield carrier | 1.5 s | 36 | 3× normal, for as long as the shield layer holds — see [[shield]] |
| Gun range | 1300 px | — | Default arena; 1690 px on `arena-large` — see [[arena]] |
| Bullet corridor half-width | 8 px | — | The shot is a ray with width, not a zero-width line |
| Silhouette sample span | ±6 px | — | 5 samples, 3 px apart, across the target's 12 px-wide body |
| Damage per hit | 1 hp | — | Of 3 hp per life — see [[damage-and-health]] |
| Aim turn rate | 5 brads/tick | — | ≈7°/tick; a full turn takes ≈2.1 s |
| Full turn | 256 brads | — | 0 = east (+x), increasing counter-clockwise; Red spawns aimed at 0, Blue at 128 (west) |
| Render-angle fuzz | ±20° | — | Cosmetic only, re-rolled every 12 ticks (0.5 s), since GV24 — see [[perception]] |

## Rules

### Aim: a continuous angle, not a target

Every cog has a continuous aim angle in **brads** (256 units per full turn,
0 = east, increasing counter-clockwise), rotated by holding **B**
(counter-clockwise) or **Select** (clockwise) — two of the eight
[[action-mask]] bits — at 5 brads/tick. Holding both cancels
to no turn at all, the same cancellation the d-pad applies to opposing
directions. On spawn and every respawn your aim already points toward the
enemy side, so the first frame of a life is already looking down the lane.
Aim is fully decoupled from the d-pad: see [[movement]] for the locomotion
side of that split.

### Aim is not observable

**Nothing on the wire ever reports an exact aim angle** — not your own, not a
teammate's, not an enemy's. A policy knows its own aim only by tracking the
turn commands it has issued itself; there is no absolute readback. Since
GV24, every rendered gun in a player's own view — enemies, teammates,
corpses, and your own self marker alike — is drawn at the true aim plus a
deterministic pseudo-random offset of up to ±20°, re-rolled roughly twice a
second. This fuzz is purely cosmetic: it changes what an onlooker's screen
shows, never the locked angle actually used to resolve a shot. Full mechanic,
including the retired floating aim indicator, on [[perception]].

### The pull locks the shot

**This locked-aim model belongs to the gun only.** Fire (**A**, bit 32) is
edge-triggered: a shot arms only on the tick the button transitions from
released to held, and holding it down does nothing further. If the cooldown
has finished and no windup is already pending, the pull captures your
**current aim angle** and starts a 5-tick countdown. **Movement is completely
unrestricted during the windup** — you move at full speed while a shot is
queued, and the eventual bullet's position comes from wherever you end up. A
second pull during the windup, or any pull while the cooldown is still
running, is ignored outright rather than queued or buffered. **Carrying a
[[spray-can]] replaces this entire model with a live one**: the same A press
ignites the cone, but nothing about your aim is captured or frozen at that
moment — the cone re-samples your current aim on every tick of its active
window instead. See [[spray-can]] for that weapon's own timing.

### Release: hitscan from wherever you ended up

At the end of the windup the bullet resolves **instantly** along the
**locked** angle, from your **position at release** — not at the pull — so
strafing during the windup carries the shot's origin with you while its
direction stays exactly where you were looking when you pulled the trigger.
Every player's movement for the tick is applied first; every shot releasing
that same tick then resolves together against that one post-movement
snapshot, so no player's shot gets an input-processing-order advantage over
another's — a mutual quick-draw tags out both shooters at once. The cooldown
starts counting from this release, not from the original pull, so the
windup never eats into your sustained rate of fire.

### Hit resolution has zero RNG

**Whether a shot connects is never randomized — there is no accuracy roll
anywhere in the engine.** A shot is a ray cast from the shooter's position
along the locked aim angle. For every other living player, the engine samples
5 points across that player's silhouette (perpendicular to the ray, at −6,
−3, 0, +3, +6 px from their center) and counts a sample as a hit only when
**both** conditions hold: the sample falls inside the shooter's 8 px-wide
bullet corridor, **and** the shooter has a clear, unobstructed line of sight
to that exact point. The closest player with any qualifying sample along the
ray is the target; a wall stops the ray outright before it reaches anyone
behind it. This makes cover **partial, not binary** — a shoulder poking past
a corner is exactly as hittable as the silhouette samples that clear the
wall, no more and no less, while a fully-hidden body cannot be tagged through
it. **Friendly fire is on**: the first valid body on the ray is hit
regardless of team, corpses are never candidates, and the shooter cannot hit
itself.

**Only the rendered gun angle onlookers see is fuzzed.** The GV24 render fuzz
described above never touches this resolution — the locked angle used here
is the shooter's exact aim at the moment of the pull, every time, with no
random offset applied to the actual hit test.

### Rank interaction

The per-life rank ladder shortens this model twice and speeds it up once,
while retiring one buff outright — see [[ranks]] for the full ladder:

- **Windup** drops by 1 tick (5→4) from rank 1 ("tagger"), and by a further
  tick (→3) at rank 5 ("legend").
- **Cooldown** drops 25% (12→9 ticks) from rank 4 ("quickdraw").
- **Gun range is not extended by rank.** An earlier +15% step at rank 2 was
  retired in Glory 6 to a flat 100% at every rank: the buffed 1495 px would
  have exceeded the default arena's ~1400 px diagonal, so it could never have
  gated a single shot at any rank, on any map. The range calculation itself
  still runs on every shot, at every rank — only the per-rank multiplier
  table was flattened to neutral, not the code that reads it. See [[ranks]]
  for the code-versus-data distinction, and contrast the genuinely dead
  grenade-charges value on that same rank table.

### Shield interaction

A carried [[shield]] triples the fire cooldown (12→36 ticks) for as long as
its 3 hp armor layer holds. The instant that layer is fully absorbed, the
shield breaks outright and the very next cooldown re-clamps to the normal
12 ticks — see [[damage-and-health]].

## Labels

| Label | Meaning | Stream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `weapon gun` | Own weapon readout while the gun is the active weapon | Player view |
| `fire icon` | Trigger ready — gate a fire input on this, not a timer | Player view |
| `fire icon cooldown` | Gun recovering; the dimmed twin of the row above | Player view |
| `shot impact` | The only trace a shot leaves in a player's own view — a jittered ring near the landing, sound only | Player view |

**Carrying a [[spray-can]] disables the gun outright**, not just the label:
`weapon gun` becomes `weapon spray`, and firing is refused for as long as the
can is held — `fire icon` never appears, because the gun and the spray cone
are mutually exclusive weapons, not two labels racing for the same trigger.
See [[spray-can]] for what A does instead. Full label contract, including the
broadcast-only rig art (`cog gun <color>`), on [[perception]] and
[[action-mask]].

## Version history

| Version | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Wiki | Reworded the retired rank-2 gun-range buff from "rung" to "step", matching [[ranks]]'s corpus-wide rename of the same word. |
| Wiki | Clarified the locked-aim model above is gun-only; the spray cone samples aim live every tick instead of locking it — see [[spray-can]]. |
| Glory 6 | The rank-2 +15% gun-range buff retired by flattening its per-rank multiplier table to 100%; the range calculation that reads that table remains live code, run on every shot. Previously misdocumented on [[ranks]] as dead code. |
| GV24 | Rendered gun angle in player views fuzzed ±~20°, re-rolled ~2×/s; the locked aim used for hit resolution is unaffected — see [[perception]] |

  keys for B, Select, and C are documented, but A's is not recorded
